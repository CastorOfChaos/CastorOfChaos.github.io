                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p>You may call me Alcastor or Alas, I am an interdimensional cataloguer. With my many years of observations I have decided to begin writing down these worlds I have observed and sharing it with this world. This may also include my attempts to recreate some of the things I have seen in the form of artwork.</p>
                <p>My journey began years ago when I began my observations as a young dragonling. Ever since then I have been smitten by reading other people's works and then soon began to log a few of my own.</p>
                <p>In my freetime you'll find me reading, doing art, and enjoying the many other joys of life like the boon that is hottubs or spending time with friends.</p>
                <p> Side note, I am purely an amatuer in all my pursuits, but they bring me the greatest of joy as well as the support from lovely people like you reading this</p>
