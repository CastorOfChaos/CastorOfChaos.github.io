        <button class="faq-question"><span class="symbol">✧</span>What's all this interdimensonial stuff? Do you believe
            it?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Shhhhh... it's just immersion. I'm sorry to break the illusion! Hey it makes it more fun though. doesn't
                it? Or maybe that's just me.</p>

        <button class="faq-question"><span class="symbol">✧</span>Why all this effort?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Why do anything? It brings a sense of accomplishment in my life and joy. Plus fun side projects like this
                is excellent to brush up on my skills and explore things I would normally not attempt! I'll take
                whatever motivation I can.</p>

        <button class="faq-question"><span class="symbol">✧</span>Do you have any Social Media to follow? What's your
            take on any Fandom drama?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>I'm incapable of having a healthy relationship on social media engaging with a fandom. Social Media loves
                to bring up drama no matter what tags you block or words, so it's better for me to avoid it and play in
                my little corner happy and unaware. I adore seeing peoples creations and the creativity they breath into
                characters and would LOVE to make more friends into my interests, but alas I'm a softy. I do love one on
                one interactions though so please don't hesitate to reach out if you want to chit chat!</p>

        <button class="faq-question"><span class="symbol">✧</span>Do you allow Fan art and/or translations?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes! For translations please link and credit me + send me the link. For fanart this is always welcomed!
                I'd be beyond overjoyed if you shared it with me! All skill levels are welcomed and celebrated. I'm just
                flattered someone would create based on my work regardless :D!</p>

        <button class="faq-question"><span class="symbol">✧</span>Do you switch fandoms/what ships do you like?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>I go with whatever consumes my life. In the past, it was Genshin Impact and as of writing this FAQ it is
                South Park. I never know how long these hyperfixations will hyperfixate, but I am very active reading in
                Ao3 for them while they are! As for ships this varies extremely by fandom. There is many I would read
                but am unlikely to write. Me being a pure multishipper is the biggest thing to know</p>
